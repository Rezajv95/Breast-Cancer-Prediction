# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. In this project, I used the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. Also, in this project, the following algorithms have been implemented on the dataset, and finally, the accuracy of these algorithms has been compared using the matplotlib library.
algoritms:
1-Naive Bayes
2-KNN
3-Decision Tree
4-Random Forest
5-Logistics Regression
6-ANN
7-SVM
